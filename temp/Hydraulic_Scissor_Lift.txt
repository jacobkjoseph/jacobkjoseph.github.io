Hydraulic Scissor Lift
---------------------



Objective
---------
	To build a demo hydraulic scissor lift 
	and to study the underlying principles 



Background
----------
	Pascal's principle
	A pressure applied at any point in an enclosed 
	fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.

	Mechanical advantage of lever
	Lever amplifies the input distance at the output



Materials
---------
	Popsicles
	Syringes (10 ml and 20 ml)
	Tube
	Cotton swabs
	Copper wire

	

Procedure
---------
	Make 3 holes in the popsicles - right, center, left
	Connect the popsicles together to form an X
	Connect the Xs together
	Connect the top platform
	Connect the two syringes together using the tube
	Connect the output piston to the bottom X

	
	
Observations
------------
	Pascal's principle 
		1. When the input syringe piston is pushed in, 
		   the output syringe piston moves out
		   
		2. Since the input syringe is wide and the output syringe is narrow, 
		   for a short in-movement for the input syringe, 
		   the output syringe has a relatively long out-movement
	
	
	Mechanical advantage of lever
		1. When the ends of the X are brought together, 
		   the X becomes tall
		   
		2. For a short horizontal movement, 
		   the vertical movement is relatively large
	
	

Experiments
-----------

	When the input syringe piston is pushed all the way in,
		the output syringe piston moves out,
		which brings the ends of the X together,
		that extends the lift (tall and skinny)
		Maximum height =   cm

	When the input syringe piston is pulled all the way out,
		the output syringe piston moves in,
		which pushes the ends of the X apart,
		that contracts the lift (short and squished)
		Minimum height =   cm


	
Limitations	
-----------
	Compressible Fluid 
		Since air is compressible, when the input piston is pushed in, 
		the output piston does not push out as much as it would have 
		if the fluid were to be incompressible
		
	Friction
	Some input effort is lost due to friction
		Friction between syringe piston and syringe cylinder
		Friction between popsicles and cotton swabs
		Friction between popsicles and base
		
	Strength
	Since popsicles are not very strong, 
		the lift is not very strong and hence can not bear heavy loads.

	

To try next
-----------
	Replace air with water
		water is less compressible than air
		
	Replace popsicles with wood or metal
		stronger material can build a sturdier lift which can lift heavier loads
