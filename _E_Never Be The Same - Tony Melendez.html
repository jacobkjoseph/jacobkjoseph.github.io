Today is filled with love
Today is like no other day before
You and I will never be the same.

I give you all my love
This day and every day
Forever and forever 
In our joys and in our pains.

We become the sign of love
Our God has given us
We become the witness to His grace.

We fill the day with love
Today is like no other day before
and even more
You and I will never be the same.

I union with our God
We are become as one
In Him we will bring light
into the dark.

We fill the day with love
Today is like no other day before
and even more
You and I will never be the same.
