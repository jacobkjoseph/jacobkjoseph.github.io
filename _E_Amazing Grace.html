Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     D                   A
That saved a wretch like me
  D                  G       D
I once was lost, but now I'm found
    D         A     D
Was blind but now I see

Chorus:
              G                  D
My chains are gone, I've been set free.
          G                   D
My God, My Savior has ransomed me.
          G               Bm
And like a flood his mercy reigns.
         A              D
Un-ending love, amazing grace


Verse 2:
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

Verse 3:
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Verse 4:
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call’d me here below,
Will be forever mine.
(Will be forever mine)
(You are forever mine)
