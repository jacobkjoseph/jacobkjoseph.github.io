Em         C             G
Water You turned into wine
Em          C              G 
Opened the eyes of the blind
               Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You

Em        C               G
Into the darkness You shine
Em          C          G
Out of the ashes we rise
                Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You

Chorus:
Em
Our God is greater
C
Our God is stronger 
G                       D

Awesome in power

Our God, Our God

Verse 2:
Em        C               G
Into the darkness You shine
Em          C          G
Out of the ashes we rise 
               Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You
