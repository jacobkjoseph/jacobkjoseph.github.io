Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
D      A
God of glory, Lord of love;
D        A
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
D       A      G   D
Op'ning to the sun above.


A        D         A       D
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
A     D           G     A
Drive the dark of doubt away;
D     A
Giver of immortal gladness,

Fill us with the light of day!


D       A      
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
D           A           
Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,

Stars and angels sing around Thee,
D      A    G      D
Center of unbroken praise.

A         D       A        D
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
A       D       G        A
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,
D       A
Singing bird and flowing fountain
D       A    G     D
Call us to rejoice in Thee. 


D        A
Thou art giving and forgiving,
D        A
Ever blessing, ever blest,
D          A
Wellspring of the joy of living,
D      A        G    D
Ocean depth of happy rest!

A        D       A          D
Thou our Father, Christ our Brother,
A       D       G        A
All who live in love are Thine;
D        A
Teach us how to love each other,
D       A      G   D
Lift us to the joy divine.

D        A
Mortals, join the happy chorus,
D         A
Which the morning stars began;
D      A
Father love is reigning o'er us,
D       A    G         D
Brother love binds man to man.

A    D        A        D
Ever singing, march we onward,
A       D      G        A
Victors in the midst of strife,
D      A
Joyful music leads us Sunward
D      A       G    D
In the triumph song of life.
