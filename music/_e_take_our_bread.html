Take our bread, we  ask you, take our hearts, we love you,
          C        Dm             G             C
take our lives, oh Father, we are yours, we are yours.

C           Am           C         Am 
Yours as we stand at the table you set,
C           Am                Dm              G7 
yours as we eat the bread our hearts can't forget,
C          Am           C            Am 
we are the sign of your life with us yet,
       Em            G      
we are yours, we are yours

Chorus:
C         Am              C              Am
Your holy people standing washed in your blood,
C                 Am         Dm        G7 
Spirit-filled yet hungry we await your food,
       C               Am                    C            Am  
we are poor, but we've brought ourselves the best that we could,
       Em            G 
we are yours, we are yours.</pre>
