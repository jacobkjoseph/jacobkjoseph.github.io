You Never Let Go (Even Though I Walk)

ORDER: I V1 PC C V2 PC C B C C E 

INTRO: A

VERSE 1:
              A2
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
     D2/F#
Your perfect love is casting out fear
                  A2
And even when I’m caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
  D2/F#
I won’t turn back, I know You are near. 

PRECHORUS:
                   F#m7 E A2               F#m7 E A2
And I will fear no evil,     for my god is with me
                 F#m7 E A2                   E
And if my god is with me,  whom then shall I fear? 
                  D2
Whom then shall I fear?

CHORUS:
A2
Oh no, You never let me go, through the calm and through the storm
F#m7
Oh no, You never let go, in every high and every low
Esus                     D2                           A2  Esus  D2
Oh no, You never let go, Lord, You never let go of me.  

VERSE 2:
              A2
And I can see a light, that is coming, for the heart that holds on
     D2/F#
A glorious light beyond all compare
                  A2
And there will be an end, to these troubles, but until that day comes
  D2/F#
We’ll live to know You here on earth.  

BRIDGE:
A2
Yes, I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on, 
                     F#m7
And there will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes, 
Esus                     D2                       A2  Esus  D2 
Still I will praise You, still I will praise You.  

ENDING:
    A2                                   Esus  D2
You keep on running and you never let go
        D2                          A2
Singing Lord You never let go of me
