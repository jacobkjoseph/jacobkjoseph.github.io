           Am     Dm
You are my hiding place
G           C
You always fill my heart
     F          Dm
with songs of deliverence
    E                                Am
Whenever I am afraid I will trust in You


CHORUS: 
       Dm       G
I will trust in You
        C        F    Dm
Let the weak say I am strong
       E
In the strength of the Lord
                Am
I will trust in You
