You shall cross the barren desert, but you shall not die of thirst.
         C                                Am               D 
You shall wander far in safety, though you do not know the way.
          G                    Em      Am       C            D 
You shall speak your words in foreign lands and all will understand.
G         Em      A               D 
You shall see the face of God and live.

G               D    G 
Be not afraid, I go before you always.

Come follow me, and I will give you rest.

G                                                           D
If you pass through raging waters, in the sea you shall not drown.
       C                              Am                D 
If you walk among the burning flames, you shall not be harmed.
        G               Em      Am          C               D 
If you stand before the pow'r of hell, and death is at your side,

And if wicked men insult and hate you, all because of me,

Blessed-blessed, are you

Come follow me, and I will give you rest.</pre>
