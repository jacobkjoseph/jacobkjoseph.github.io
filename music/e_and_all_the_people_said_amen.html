You are not alone, if you are lonely
C       G              D        Em
When you feel afraid, you're not the only
C       G              D        Em
We are all the same, in need of mercy
C               G               D
To be forgiven and be free
Am                       Em               D
It's all you got to lean on but thank God it's all you need

Chorus
G               D               G 
And all the people said Amen, woah
C               G               D
And all the people said Amen
C               G                A              Em 
Give thanks to the Lord for His love never ends
C                D              G
And all the people said Amen

Verse 2
C       G              D        Em
If you're rich or poor, well it don't matter
C       G              D        Em
Weak or strong, you know love is what we're after
C       G              D        Em
We're all broken, but we're all in this together
C               G               D       
God knows we stumble and 
Am                      Em               D
And He so loved the world, He sent His son to save us all

Bridge
C               G               D               G
Blessed are the poor in spirit who are torn apart
C               G               D               G
Blessed are the persecuted and the pure in heart
C            G               D                  Em
Blessed are the people hungry for another start
A                               D 
For this his the kingdom, the kindom of God</pre>
