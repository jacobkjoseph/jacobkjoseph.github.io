As the deer panteth for the water
       F            G     C    F C
So my soul longeth after Thee
C    G           Am      C
You alone are my heart's desire
       F      Dm7     C  
And I long to worship Thee.

Am               F           C
You alone are my strength my shield

So much more than any thing

only you can satisfy

You alone are the real joygiver

and the apple of my eye
