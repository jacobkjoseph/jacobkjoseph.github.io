       C                  F
When I look into your holiness
       C                    F
When I gaze into your loveliness
         C              Em
When all things that surround
       F                       G
Become shadows in the light of You


VERSE 2: 
          C                              F
When I've found the joy of reaching your heart
        C                               F
When my will becomes enthralled in your love
         C              Em
When all things that surround
       F                       G
Become shadows in the light of You


CHORUS: 
          F    G            Em  Am
I worship You,    I worship You
    Dm                  G       C
The reason I live is to worship You
          F    G           Em  Am
I worship You,    I worship You
    Dm                  G       C
The reason I live is to worship You


ENDING: C
