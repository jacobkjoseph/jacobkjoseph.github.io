God is good all the time
            G                      A
He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine
         D           Bm
God is good all the time
               G               A          A7
through the darkest night His light will shine
        G            A7           D
God is good, God is good all the time

           D                     Bm
if you're walking through the valley
                  G          A
and there are shadows all around
         A             Bm
do not fear, He will guide you
          G                 A
He will keep you safe and sound
              G                A
for He has promised to never leave you
        G
nor forsake you
         A        A7
and His word is true


Verse 2 (do verse 1 chords)
           D                     Bm
we are sinners, so unworthy
                  G          A
and for us He choose to die
         A             Bm
filled us with His Holy Spirit
                  G          A
that we can stand and testify
                  G          A
that His love is everlasting
G
and His mercy, 
A               A7
they will never end


Refrain:
         Bm             A
though i may not understand
      C                G
the plans You have for me
    Bm              A
my life is in Your hand
             G
and in the eyes of faith
               A
i can clearly see...
