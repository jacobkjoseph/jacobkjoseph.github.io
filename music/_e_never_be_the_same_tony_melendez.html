You and I will never be the same.

D
I give you all my love
A
This day and every day

Forever and forever 

In our joys and in our pains.



We become the sign of love

Our God has given us

We become the witness to His grace.



We fill the day with love

Today is like no other day before

and even more

You and I will never be the same.



In union with our God

We are become as one

In Him we will bring light

into the dark.



We fill the day with love

Today is like no other day before

and even more

You and I will never be the same.
