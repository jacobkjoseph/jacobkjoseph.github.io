D                   A
I come before You today,
Em                              Bm
and there's just one thing that I want to say
G           A     G           A
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord
D                       A
For all You've given to me,
Em                         Bm
for all the blessings that I cannot see
G           A     G           A
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

Chorus:
D                     A
With a grateful heart, with a song of praise
Bm                     G
With an outstretched arm I'll bless Your Name and
  D        A                    G          A 
Thank You, Lord, I just want to thank You, Lord
  D        A                    G          A 
Thank You, Lord, I just want to thank You, Lord
A          D
Thank you Lord

D                   A
For all You've done in my life,
Em                              Bm
You took my darkness and gave me Your light
G           A     G           A
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord
D                   A
You took my sin and my shame,
Em                              Bm
You took my sickness and heal all my pain
G           A     G           A
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord</pre>
