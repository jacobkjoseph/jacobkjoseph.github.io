Um Azhagaana Kangal ennai kandathaalae

CHORUS
My Jesus, my Shepherd, Please seek and save me
My Jesus, my Saviour, I need You daily

VERSE
I was lost, I was helpless, Troubled and hopeless
When I strayed in sin and pride
But You came with compassion, You came with Your mercy
With love You brought me to Your side

VERSE
I was hurt, I was broken, Alone and forgotten
When I didn't listen to Your voice
But You spoke with compassion, You spoke with Your mercy
Your words are healing me inside
