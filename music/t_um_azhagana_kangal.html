D                         G          A 
Um Azhagaana Kangal ennai kandathaalae
D                               G                D
Mudinthathentru ninaiththa naan uyir vaazhkintraen

VERSE
       D         Em    F#m      A
Yaarum ariyaatha ennai Nantraai arinthu
G                       D 
thaedivantha nalla naesarae

VERSE
       D           F#m   D            Em
Thooki eriyappatta ennai Vaendumentru solli
G               D          A 
Saerththu konda nalla naesarae

VERSE
       D           F#m   D            Em
Ontrumillatha ennai um Kaarunyaththaalae
G               D          A 
Uyarththi vaiththa nalla naesarae


CHORUS
D                             G             A 
My Jesus, my Shepherd, please seek and save me
D                       G           D
My Jesus, my Saviour, I need You daily

VERSE
       D          Em        F#m          A
I was lost, I was helpless, troubled and hopeless
G               D           A 
When I strayed into sin and pride
        D         Em              F#m            A
But You came with compassion, You came with Your mercy
G                     D          A 
With love You brought me to Your side

VERSE
I was hurt, I was broken, Alone and forgotten
When I didn't listen to Your voice
But You spoke with compassion, You spoke with Your mercy
Your words are healing me inside
