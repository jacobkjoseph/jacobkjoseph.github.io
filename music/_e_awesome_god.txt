Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from heaven above  
     C       G                   Am       Bm       Em  
With wisdom, pow'r and love, our God is an awesome God
  
    Em 
Oh when He rolls up His sleeves He ain't just puttin' on the ritz,  
     C         D       Em  
Our God is an awesome God  
        Em  
There's thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists,  
    C         D        Em  
Our God is an awesome God  
         C  
And the Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden  
    D                            Em  
It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood   
      C                                                           C         D       Em  
His return is very soon and so you'd better be believin' that Our God is an awesome God  
 
             Em  
And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,  
     C         D       Em  
Our God is an awesome God  
    Em  
He spoke into the darkness and created the light,  
     C         D       Em  
Our God is an awesome God  
        C                                      
And judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom, 
D                  Em  
mercy and grace He gave us at the cross       
 C                                                               D       Em  
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that Our God is an awesome God
