Christ has no body now but yours,
   D                            A
No hands, no feet on earth but yours,
              G                  D
Yours are the eyes with which he looks
         Bm
with compassion on this world,
Em                                A
Yours are the feet with which he walks to do good,
              G                                    D
Yours are the hands, with which he blesses all the world.
              G                    D
Yours are the hands, yours are the feet,
              G                 A
Yours are the eyes, you are his body.        </pre>
