  When the music fades all is stripped away and i simply come 
D                     A                          G                            Asus A
  Longing just to bring  something that's of worth that will bless your heart

Prechorus
  Em             D              A                  Em              D               A
  I'll bring you more than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required
  Em              D           A                            Em                D       A
  you search much deeper within through the way things appear you're looking into my heart 

Chorus
  D                      A                         Em                 G             A   D
  I'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all about you Jesus 

  D                      A                         Em                 G             A   D
  I'm sorry lord for the thing I made it when it's all about you it's all about you Jesus 

D                 A                        G                      Asus A
  King of endless worth no one could express how much you deserve
D                     A                      G                     Asus A
  though i'm weak and poor all i have is yours every single breath</pre>
