Strumming pattern: All Down strokes

Em         C             G
Water You turned into wine
Em          C              G 
Opened the eyes of the blind
               Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You

Em        C               G
Into the darkness You shine
Em          C          G
Out of the ashes we rise
                Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You

Chorus:
Em
Our God is greater
C
Our God is stronger 
G                       D
God You are higher than any other
Em
Our God is healer
C
Awesome in power
     G        D
Our God, Our God

Verse 2:
Em        C               G
Into the darkness You shine
Em          C          G
Out of the ashes we rise 
               Am7
There's no one like You
          D
None like You

(Chorus)

Bridge (2x):

Em 
And if our God is for us
C
Then who could ever stop us
G
And if our God is with us
D/F# (D 2nd time)
Then what could stand against        </pre>
