Em             G
Sanctify me Oh God
           D               Am
Cleanse my body, mind and soul
    G                 Em 
Purify me and make me whole.

B                      A    E 
Help me to put off my old self
                      D         B
Corrupted by all its deceitful desires
A      B   G#m                    C#m 
Create me anew in your likeness O Lord
         A            B
Make me righteous and holy.


Let me not confirm any longer

To the pattern set by the ways of the world

May I offer myself as a living sacrifice

That is holy and pleasing.


Strengthen me with power through your Spirit

Transform me christ in the full of Your love

That I may perceive the length the breadth the depth

And the height of Your love Lord.
