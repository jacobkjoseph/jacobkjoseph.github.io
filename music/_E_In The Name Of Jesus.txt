D
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus
                 A
We have the victory

In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus
                   D
Satan will have to flee
G
When we stand in the name of Jesus
A               D
tell me who can stand before,
G               D
in the precious name of Jesus,
A                D  
We have the victory.
