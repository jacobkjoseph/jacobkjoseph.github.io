C                  Dm7 
Change my heart oh God
G             C 
make it ever true
C                  Dm7
Change my heart oh God
G             C 
may I be like You 
 
C              Am 
You are the potter
G       C 
I am the clay, 
C                Am 
mold me and make me, 
G       D         G 
this is what I pray.
