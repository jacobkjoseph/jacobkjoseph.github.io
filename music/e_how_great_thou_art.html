O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
         G                 D          G
consider all the works Thy hands have made.
          G                 C 
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
                 G       D        G
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

Chorus:
               G        C             G
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
               Am7                 G
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
                G      C              G
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
               Am7      C          G
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!


When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;


And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin


When Christ shall come, with shouts of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, My God, how great You are!</pre>
