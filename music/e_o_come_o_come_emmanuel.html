O come, O come, Emmanuel,
     C             Dm G Am
And ransom captive Israel,
     Dm              C Em  G
That morns in lonely exile here
  Am             Dm  G  Am
Until the Son of God appear.
  G        Am      Dm G Am
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel,
       C            Dm  Em Am
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

O come, Thou Wisdom, from on high,
And order all things far and nigh;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And teach us in her ways to go.
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan’s tyranny,
From depths of hell Thy people save,
And give them vict’ry o’er the grave.
Nails, spears, shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

O come, Thou Key of David, come,
And open wide our heav’nly home,
Make safe the way that leads on high,
That we no more have cause to sigh.
Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby.
Joy, joy for Christ is born,
the Babe, the Son of Mary!

O come, Desire of Nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid every strife and quarrel cease
And fill the world with heaven’s peace.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel,
Shall come to thee, O Israel!

Veni, veni, Emmanuel
Captivum solve Israel,
Qui gemit in exilio,
Privatus Dei Filio.
Gaude! Gaude! Emmanuel,
Nascetur pro te Israel!

Veni, veni, Rex Gentium,
Veni, Redemptor omnium,
Ut salvas tuos famulos
Peccati sibi conscios.
Gaude! Gaude! Emmanuel,
Nascetur pro te Israel!</pre>
