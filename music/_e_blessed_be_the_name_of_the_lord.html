Though i walk through the wilderness, blessed be your name

when the darkness closes in lord still i will say

Blessed be your name when the sun's shining down on me
               A         E                    D    
when the world's 'all as it should be', blessed be your name

Though there's pain in the offering, blessed be your name

my heart will choose to say Lord blessed be your name</pre>
