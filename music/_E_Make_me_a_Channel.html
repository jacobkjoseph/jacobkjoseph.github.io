Make me a channel of Your peace                
                                     G
Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love
      F
Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord
                             C     G  C    
And where there's doubt true faith in You

  F                Refrain:     C
O Master grant that I may never seek
               
   F                            C- F- C
So much to be consoled as to console
      F                     C
To be understood, as to understand
                 
      D                        G- D- G
To be loved, as to love with all my soul!!

C
Make me a channel of Your peace
                                 
                                        G
Where there's despair in life, let me bring hope
      F
Where there is darkness, only light
                   C-G- C
And where there's sadness, ever joy   (Refrain)

C
Make me a channel of Your peace
                G
It is in pardoning, that we are pardoned
   F
In giving to all men, that we receive
            C       G       C
And in dying that we're born to eternal life  (Refrain)        </pre>
