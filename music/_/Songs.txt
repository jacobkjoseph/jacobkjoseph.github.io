INDEX
Abba father let me be
Yours and Yours alone
May my will forever be
Yours and Yours alone
Never let my heart grow cold
Never let me go
Above all powers,
above all kings
Above all nature
and all created things
Above all wisdom
and all the ways of man
You were here
before the world began
Above all kingdoms,
above all thrones
Above all wonders
the world has ever known
Above all wealth
and treasures of the earth
There’s no way to
measure what your worth
Crucified,
Laid behind a stone
You lived to die,
rejected and alone
Like a rose,
trampled on the ground
You took the fall
and thought of me,
Above all
One single drop of rain
Your salty tear
became blue ocean
One tiny grain of sand
turning in your hand
A world in motion
You’re out beyond the
furthest morning star
Close enough to hold me in
Your arms
Adonai
I lift up my heart and I cry
My Adonai
You are maker of each moment
Father of my hope and freedom
Oh, my Adonai
One timid faithful knock
Resounds upon the
rock of ages
One trembling heart and soul
Becomes a servant bold and
courageous
You call across the
mountains and the seas
I answer from the
deepest part of me
From age to age
you reign in majesty
And today you’re
making miracles in me
Alabare, alabare,
alabare a mi Senor [2]
John saw the number,
of all those redeemed,
And all were singing
praises to the Lord
Thousands were praying
ten thousands rejoicing
And all were singing
praises to the Lord
There's no God
as great as you, O Lord
There is none, there is none!
(repeat)
There's no God who
does the mighty wonders
That the Lord
our God has done!
(repeat)
Not with an army,
nor with their weapons,
But by the
Holy Spirit's Power
(repeat)
And even mountains
shall be moved [3]
By the Holy Spirit's power
And even India
shall be saved [3]
By the Holy Spirit's power
Alive, Alive, Alive
for ever more
My Jesus is alive
Alive for ever more
Sing Hallelujah (2)
My Jesus is alive
forever more
Sing Hallelujah (2)
My Jesus is alive
All consuming fire,
You’re my hearts desire
And I love You dearly,
dearly Lord
You’re my meditation,
and my Consolation
And I love You dearly,
dearly Lord
Glory to the lamb
I exalt the great I AM
Reigning on Your
glorious throne
You are my eternal home
All Heaven declares
the glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare
with the beauty of the Lord
Forever He will be
the Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
and worship Him alone
I will proclaim
the glory of the Risen Lord
Who once was slain,
to reconcile man to God
You are my strength
when I am weak
You are the treasure
that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking You as a
precious jewel
Lord to give up, I’d be a fool
Your are my all in all
Jesus, Lamb of God,
worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God,
worthy is Your name
Taking my sin, my cross,
my shame
Rising again, I bless Your name
Your are my all in all
When I fall down,
You pick me up
When I am dry,
You fill my cup
You are my all in all
Almighty God my redeemer
My hiding place my safe refuge,
no other name like Jesus
No power can stand against You.
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from
You alone
My Lord and my salvation
Your praise is always on my lips
Your word is living in my heart
And I will praise You
with a new song
My soul will bless You Lord
When I am weak,
you make me strong
When I’m poor, I know I’m rich
for in the power of Your name
All things are possible ( 4 )
All who are thirsty
All who are weak
Come to the fountain
Dip your heart in
the stream of life
Let the pain and the sorrow
Be washed away
In the waves of His mercy
As deep cries out to the deep
Come Lord Jesus come
I need You more and more
Amazing Grace!
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost,
but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
’Twas Grace that taught my
heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that
Grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils,
and snares
I have already come.
’Tis Grace hath brought me
safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promised
good to me.
His Word my hope secures.
He will my shield
and portion be
As long as life endures.
When we’ve been there
ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing
God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun.
Blessing and honor,
glory and power
Be unto the Ancient of Days
From every nation,
all of creation
Bow before the Ancient of Days
Every tongue in
Heaven and Earth
Shall declare your glory
Every knee shall
bow at your throne
And worship
You will be exalted, Oh God
And your kingdom
shall not pass away
Oh Ancient of Days
Your kingdom shall reign
over all the Earth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
For none can compare to
your matchless worth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days
For You are good, Your love
endures forever
And we rejoice in Your
unfailing love.
Consume our praise with fire
down from heaven
And fill us with Your power
from above
Arise, arise, arise
Oh Lord, our God, arise!
Arise, oh Lord, within our midst
As we declare
Your righteousness;
Lift up the name
that we confess
As we proclaim Your holiness
Salvation comes from
You alone
Oh Lamb of God,
the chosen One.
That we might be
Your resting place
We worship You,
we seek Your face
Arise shine out for
your light has come
The glory of Yahweh
is rising on you
Though night still
covers the earth
And darkness the people
Above you, Yahweh now
rises above you
His glory appears, arise!
No more will the sun give
you day light
Nor moon light shine on you
But Yahweh will be
your eternal light
Your God will be your splendour
Your sun will set no more,
nor your moon wane
But Yahweh will be your
eternal light
And your days of mourning
will pass from your sight
As darkness awaits the dawn
Morning awaits creation’s song
And with the rising sun
Hope comes alive to carry on
The light of life is shinning on
The dark of night can’t overcome
The light of life that
burns so bright
Can take the wrong and
make it right
Everyday people pray
they’ll find the strength
To make it through
While there’s one who waits
To fill their hearts
with life anew
The light of life keeps shining on
The dark of night can’t overcome
The light of life that
burns so bright
Can touch the blind and
Give them sight (2)
Free us from guilt and sin
God sent his son for everyone
And all who believe in him
Know that new life
has just begun
The light of life keeps shining on
The dark of night
can’t overcome
The light of life is Jesus Christ
Come lift your praise
and worship him
As I kneel before you
As I bow my head in prayer
Take this day, Make it yours
And fill me with your love
Ave Maria,
Gratia plena
Dominus tecum,
Benedicta tu
All I have I give you
Every dream and wish are yours
Mother of Christ,
Mother of mine
Present them to my Lord
As I kneel before you
And I see your smiling face
Every thought, Every word
Is lost in your embrace
As the deer panteth
for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my hearts desire
And I long to worship You
You alone are my strength,
my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my
hearts desire and I long
To worship You
You’re my friend and
You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything
I want you more than
gold or silver
Only you can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver
And the apple of my eye
As we gather
in this place today
Holy Spirit come
and have your way
Have your way
As we lay aside
our own desires
Sweep across our hearts
with holy fire
Lord have your way
This is your house, your home
We welcome you
Lord we welcome you
This is your house, your home
We welcome you today
As we offer up our
hearts and lives
Let them be a living sacrifice
Have your way
Be glorified in
everything we do
Be glorified in
everything we say
Have your way.
I know a place
A wonderful place
Where accused and condemned
Find mercy and grace
Where the wrongs
we have done
And the wrongs done to us
Were nailed there with him
There on the cross
At the cross, at the cross
You died for our sins
At the cross, at the cross
You gave us life again
Oh when He rolls up
His sleeves,
He ain’t just puttin’ on the ritz
Our God is an awesome God
There is thunder in
His footsteps
and lightning in His fists
Our God is an awesome God
And the Lord wasn’t joking
when He kicked
‘em out of Eden
It wasn’t for no reason that He
shed His blood
His return is very close and so
you better be
believin’ that Our God is an
awesome God
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God
And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night
Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
and created the light
Our God is an awesome God
And Judgment and wrath He
poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace
He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too
quickly forgotten
That Our God is
an awesome God
Baruch ha ba, B'shem Adonai
Blessed is He who comes

I sing beneath the shadow of
Your wings

Better is one day in
Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
One thing I ask and
I would seek,
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your
glory dwells
My heart and flesh cry out,
For You the living God
Your spirit’s water for my soul
I’ve tasted and I’ve seen,
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You (2)
Bind us together Lord

That cannot be broken

Never knowing of His light
(Oh the Lord is good)
I did not think
I could have peace
(Oh the Lord is good)
Trapped inside by
fear and shame
(Oh the Lord is good)
You wiped away all of my grief
(Oh the Lord is good)
When I believed upon
Your name

Come as you are,
You can be the friend of God
Humble yourself and
Give Him your heart

Surrender now,

Come if your heart is searching
Come if your soul is thirsty
Draw near and drink of the
mercy of Jesus Christ
At the river of life

For we are His people
The flock that He shepherds
Halleluiah
Come, now is the
Time to worship
Come, now is the
Time to give your heart

One day every tongue will
confess You are God
One day every knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure
remains for those
Who gladly choose You now,
Come..
I wandered far away from God
Now I'm coming home
The paths of sin
too long I've trod
Lord I'm coming Home
Coming Home, Coming Home
Never more to roam
Open are thine arms of love
Lord I'm coming home
I've wasted many
precious years
Now I'm coming home
I now repent with bitter tears
Lord I'm coming home
Coming Home, Coming Home
Never more to roam
Open are thine arms of love
Lord I'm coming home
I've sinned against
my brother too
Now I'm coming home
By hurting him,
I've tortured You
Lord, I'm coming home
Coming Home, Coming Home
Never more to roam
Open are thine arms of love
Lord I'm coming home
These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the Word of the Lord
And these are the
days of your servant Moses,
Righteousness being restored
And though these are
days of great trials,
Of famine and darkness
and sword
Still, we are the voice in the
desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord
Behold He comes,
Riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun at the
trumpet call
So lift your voice,
It’s the year of jubilee
And out of Zion’s hill,
salvation comes
And these are the
days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones
becoming as flesh.
And these are the days of
Your servant, David,
Rebuilding the temple of praise
And these are the
days of the harvest,
The fields are as
white in the world.
And we are the laborers
in Your vineyard,
Declaring the word of the Lord
Behold He comes,
Riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun at the
trumpet call
So lift your voice,
It’s the year of jubilee
And out of Zion’s hill,
salvation comes
There’s no God like Jehovah...
Did you feel the
mountains tremble?
Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose
to sing of
Jesus Christ the risen One
Did you feel the
people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of
Jesus Christ the saving One.
And we can see that
God You’re moving
A mighty river through
the nations
And young and old
will turn to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepared the way of
the risen Lord
Open up the doors and
let the music play
Let the streets resound
with singing
Songs that bring your hope
Songs that bring your joy
Dancers who dance upon
injustice
Do you feel the
darkness tremble
When all the saints
join in one song?
And all the streams
flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness
Don’t you know it’s time to
praise the Lord
In the sanctuary
of His Holy Spirit
So set your mind on him
And let your praise begin
And the glory of the Lord will
fill this place
Praise the Lord (echo) (2)
He lives within
the praises of His people
He loves to hear us
call upon His name
So set your mind on him
And let your praise begin
And the glory of the Lord will
fill this place
Praise the Lord (echo) (4)
Don't build your house
on the sandy land
Don't build it
too near the shore
Oh it might be kind of nice
And you'll have to do it twice
And you'll have to build your
house once more
But if you build your house
upon the rock
And put a sure foundation
on the solid spot
The storms may come and go
But the peace of God
you'll know
Down the mountains
the river flows
And it brings refreshing
wherever it goes
Through the valleys
and over the fields
The river is rushing and
the river is here
The river of God sets our
feet a dancing
The river of God fills our
hearts with cheer
The river of God fills our
mouths with laughter
And we rejoice for the
river is here
The river of God is
teeming with life
and all who touch it
can be revived
And those who linger on
this river’s shore
Will come back thirsting for
more of the Lord
The river of God sets our
feet a dancing
The river of God fills our
hearts with cheer
The river of God fills our
mouths with laughter
And we rejoice for the
river is here
Up to the mountain
we love to go
To find the presence
of the Lord
Along the banks of
the river we run
We dance with laughter giving
praise to the son
The river of God sets our
feet a dancing
The river of God fills our
hearts with cheer
The river of God fills our
mouths with laughter
And we rejoice for the
river is here
Look upon this fearful scene
The King of Love
nailed to a tree
The Prince of Glory
made to bleed
Hear the pardon that
He speaks
“Forgive them,” is His plea
Where has love like
this been seen?
Let us lift up endless praises
Let us give Him endless song
Let us lift up endless praises
Let us sing of all He’s done
Let us sing of all our
God has done
Look upon this wondrous sight
Foul sinners clothed in white
With the righteousness
of Christ
All our guilt is washed away
Every debt we owed is paid
How astounding is
this grace?
You are my supply,
my breath of life
Still more awesome than I know
You are my reward,
worth living for

I make in you
You make me move Jesus

Every step I take,

Waves of Mercy,
waves of grace
Everywhere I look
I see your face
Your love has captured me
Oh my God this love,
how can it be?
Every tongue and tribe
Gathered round your throne
With one voice we cry
Holy Lord
Every tongue and tribe (3)

All Your scars will still remain.

We give our all to praise Him
And lift our voice in
declaration
Hear our prayer,
we are Your children
And we’ve gathered
here today
We’ve gathered here to pray
Hear our cry,
Lord we need Your mercy
And we need Your grace today
Hear us as we pray
Our Father,
who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Our Father,
hear us from heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
Hear our song,
as it rises to Heaven
May Your glory fill the earth
As the waters cov’r the sea
See our heart
and remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to You today
Though we are few,
we’re surrounded by many
Who have crossed that
river before
And this is the song we’ll be
singing forever
Holy is the Lord ...
When the music fades,
all is striped away
And I simply come,
Longing just to bring
Something that’s of worth,
that will bless your heart
I’ll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
Your looking into my heart
I am coming back to the
Heart of worship
And its all about You,
its all about you Jesus
I am sorry Lord for the
thing I’ve made it
When It’s all about you,
all about you Jesus
King of endless worth,
no one could express
How much you deserve.
Though I’m weak and poor,
all I have is yours,
Every single breath
I’ll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
Your looking into my heart
I am coming back to the
Heart of worship
And its all about You,
its all about you Jesus
I am sorry Lord for the
thing I’ve made it
When It’s all about you,
all about you Jesus

build your secrets slowly
Day by day you’ll grow too
You’ll know heavens glory
In bread we bring You Lord
Our bodies’ labour
In wine we offer You
Our spirit’s grief
We do not ask You Lord
Who is my neighbour
But stand united now
One in Belief
Oh we have gladly heard
Your word, Your Holy Word
And now in answer Lord
Our gifts we bring
Our selfish hearts make true
Our failing faith renew
Our hearts belong to You
Our Lord and King

Let the poor man say

Let the lost man say

Let the river flow (2)
Holy spirit come

Lord say so (3x)
I’m redeemed, I'm redeemed
praise the Lord
Ah Lord God Thou has made

And earth by thy great power

outstretched hands
Nothing is too difficult
for Thee(2)
Great and mighty God
Great in counsel mighty indeed
Nothing, nothing
absolutely nothing
Nothing is too difficult for thee
What a mighty
God we serve (3x)
Angels bow before Him
Heaven and earth adore Him
What a mighty God we serve
Let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Let the blind say I can see
It’s what the Lord has
done in me
Hosanna, hosanna

Jesus died and rose again
Into the river I will wade
There my sins are
washed away
From the heavens
mercy streams
Of the Savior’s love for me
I will rise from the

Into the saving arms of God

Jesus Christ has set me free

Blaze Spirit blaze
Set our hearts on fire
Flow river flow
Flood the nations with
grace and mercy
Send forth your word
Lord, and let there be light
Lift up your heads,
O you gates
Swing open wide,
You ancient doors
Let the King of Kings
Take His rightful place
Make room, make way,
For our King of Grace
Lift up your hands,
Open up your hearts
His victory over sin and
death is ours
Let the King of Kings
Take His rightful place
Make room make way,
For our King of grace
Who is this King of Glory
Lord of power
His name is Jesus our
risen King
Who is this King so mighty
Lord of strength
His name is Jesus our
risen King
The One that we have seen
with our own eyes
The One that we have touched
and felt with our own hands
The One that we have heard
with our own ears
The One that in the depths of
our hearts we have met
He is the One who we
proclaim to you
His splendor is on all, for he
shines upon the world
So many in our world drift
into sleep
While others only know a
darkness without end
Let brothers rise to call them
from the deep
Let sisters take their hands to
heal and be their friends
Together, let us stand
against the storm
And in the heart of night,
be the watchers of the morn
The light of the world,
salt of the earth
We scatter the darkness,
when love becomes our way
The light of the world,
Christ is our light
We shine with his brightness,
The reflection of his light
from day to day
So many feel that they have
yet to find
The meaning of their lives,
their value and their worth
If we just walked along with
hearts made kind
And listened to their tales and
sought to ease their hurt
Perhaps they’d hearken to the
news we bear,
and in the broken bread, come
to know true love and care
No worth has salt if it should
lose it’s taste
No usefulness has light if it is
hidden away!
So may our souls, our hearts,
our minds be graced
I stand to praise You
But I fall on my knees
My spirit is willing
But my flesh is so weak
Light the fire (light the fire)
In my soul (in my weary soul)
Fan the flame (fan the flame)
Make me whole
(make my spirit whole)
Lord, You know
(Lord, You know)
Just where I’ve been
(where I’ve been)
So light the fire in
my heart again
I feel Your arms around me
As the power of
Your healing begins
Your spirit moves through me
Like a mighty rushing wind
Little by little, every day
Little by little, every way
Jesus is changing me
Since I’ve made a
turnabout phase
I’ve been growing in His grace
Jesus is changing me.
He’s changing me,
my Lord and Savior,
I’m not the same person
that I used to be
Though there’s a slow growing,
but there’s a knowing,
That someday perfect I will be
Living waters flow on
Sweep away my pain
Bring Your healing to my heart
Help me love once again
Cares and worries get me down
Fear of failure fills my day
When I’m lost and at alone
Help me Lord to find Your way
Living waters flow on
Sweep away my pain
Bring Your healing to my heart
Help me love once again
People knocking at my door
Strangers seeking
love and care
Never let me turn them down
Teach me gently how to share
Living waters flow on
Sweep away my pain
Bring Your healing to my heart
Help me love once again
Children come into my life
With their laughter
and their song
When will I become like them
Teach me Lord to sing along
Living waters flow on
Sweep away my pain
Bring Your healing to my heart
Help me love once again
Look upon this fearful scene
The King of Love
nailed to a tree
The Prince of Glory
made to bleed
Hear the pardon that
He speaks
“Forgive them,” is His plea
Where has love like
this been seen?
Let us lift up endless praises
Let us give Him endless song
Let us lift up endless praises
Let us sing of all He’s done
Let us sing of all our
God has done
Look upon this wondrous sight
Foul sinners clothed in white
With the righteousness
of Christ
All our guilt is washed away
Every debt we owed is paid
How astounding is this grace?
Lord have mercy (3)
on us
Send your spirit (3)
on us
Save Your people (3)
on earth
Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
Have mercy on us
Christ, Savior, Son of God,
Have mercy on us

Every thing I’ve been through
Use it for your glory
Lord I offer my days to you
Lifting my praise to you
As a pleasing sacrifce
Lord I offer you my life
Things in the past
Things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are
Yet to come true
All of my hopes, all of my plans
My heart and my hands
Are lifted to you
Lord listen to
Your people praying
Lord send Your Spirit
in this place
Lord listen to Your people praying
Send Your love, send Your power

Something’s gonna happen

of victory in this land
When the people of the Lord
get down to pray

An Instrument of worship
I lift up my hand
to Your Name (2x)
I'll sing to you a love song
A love song of worship

to Your Name (2x)
Lord prepare me,
to be a sanctuary
Pure and Holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving
I’ll be a living Sanctuary
For you
Lord You seem so far away
A million miles or more
it feels today
And though I haven’t
lost my faith
I must confess right now
That it’s hard for me to pray
But I don’t know what to say
And I don’t know
where to start
But as you give the grace
With all that’s in my heart
I will sing, I will praise
Even in my darkest hour
Through the sorrow
and the pain
I will sing, I will praise
Lift my hands to honour you
Because your word is true
Lord it’s hard for me to see
All the thoughts and
plans you have for me
But I will put my trust in you
Knowing that you died
to set me free
But I don’t know what to say
And I don’t know where to start
But as you give the grace
With all that’s in my heart
Lord, I lift Your name on high
Lord, I love to sing your praises
I’m so glad you’re in my life
I’m so glad You came
to save us
You came from heaven to earth
to show the way
From the earth to the cross,
My debt to pay
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky
Lord, I lift your name on high
Majesty, worship his majesty
Unto Jesus be

Making Melody in my heart (3x)
Unto the king of kings
Thumbs in… Elbows out…

Rivers can not over whelm it
Oceans of fear can not

You give hope to the hopeless
You give faith to the faithless

Like the morning light
You give grace to the humble
And have mercy on
the merciful
This world’s never seen
Anybody like You
O what a wonder
A wonder You are
You hide the sun and let it rain
O what a wonder
Jesus what a wonder you are
O what a wonder
A wonder You are
To save somebody like me
O what a wonder

You bring healing to
the nations
There’s no other salvation
You’re the only one
who can turn it around
You make a way for the
wanderer
You give freedom to the prisoner
All of Hell must tremble
At the sound of Your name
Oh Lord you are beautiful
Your face is all I see
And when your eyes are
on this child
Your grace abounds to me
On bended knee I come
With a humble heart I come
Bowing down before
Your Holy throne
Lifting holy hands to you
As I pledge my love a new
I worship you in spirit
I worship you in truth
Make my life a holy
praise unto you
One Bread, One Body,
one Lord of all,
One cup of blessing
which we bless
And we, though many,
throughout the earth.
We are one body in this
one Lord
Gentile or Jew, servant or free
woman or man, no more
Many the gifts, many the
works, one in the Lord of all.
Grain in the fields,
scattered and grown,
gathered to one,
for all
Far above the star has dawned
A sign for all to heed His call
To lay aside the ceaseless toil
To follow His trail
Through the storms and
all our fears
We've gathered from
across the seas
The fragments of our broken lives
Forged by His love
Here now the promised of ages
Shines through like
a new dawn
All who travelled in darkness
They see the light
We have come bearing gifts
to Worship
One in heart one in mind before
the King
We proclaim to the world that
Jesus is the Lord of all
We have come to worship You
Down the ages the world has
yearned
Waited to see the child
who'd be
The one to set all captives free
Light of the world
The tender mercy of our God
Has shown upon our lives again
Filling us with peace and joy
Making us whole
Here now the promised of ages
Shines through like
a new dawn
All who travelled in darkness
They see the light
We have come bearing gifts
to Worship
One in heart one in mind before
the King
We proclaim to the world that
Jesus is the Lord of all
We have come to worship You
Only by grace can we enter
Only by grace can we stand
Not by our human endeavour
But by the blood of the lamb
Into your presence you draw us
You draw us to come
Into your presence you call us
And now by your grace
we come
Lord if you mark our
transgressions
Who will stand
Thanks to your grace
We are cleansed by the blood
of the Lamb
(Precious Lamb)
Lord if you mark our
transgressions
Who will stand
Thanks to your grace
We are cleansed by the blood
of the Lamb
Only by grace can we enter
Only by grace can we stand
Not by our human endeavour
But by the blood of the lamb
Into your presence you draw us
You draw us to come
Into your presence you call us
And now by Your grace
We come
Jesus..Now by Your grace
We come
Open my eyes Lord,
I want to see Jesus
To reach out and touch Him
And say that I love Him
Open my ears Lord,
Teach me to listen
Open my heart Lord,
I want to love Jesus
Open the eyes of my
heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see you
I want to see you
To see you high and lifted up
Shining in the light of
Your glory
Pour out your power and love
As we sing Holy, Holy, Holy
Our heart, our desire
Is to see the nations worship
Our cry, our prayer
Is to sing Your praise
to the ends of the earth
That with one mighty voice
Every tribe
and every tongue rejoices
Our heart, our desire
Is to see the nations
Worship You
Over all the earth,
You reign on high
Every mountain stream,
Every sunset sky
But my one request,
Lord my only aim
Is that You reign in me again
Lord reign in me,
Reign in your power
Over all my dreams,
in my darkest hour
You are the Lord, of all I am
So wont You reign in me again
Over every thought,
over every word
May my life reflect the beauty
of my Lord
You mean more to me than
any other earthly thing
So wont You reign in me again
Peace is flowing like a river,
Flowing out through
you and me,
Spreading out in the desert,
Setting all the captives free
Let it flow through me
Let it flow through me
Let the might peace of God
Flow out through me (2x)
Pierce the darkness
In the name of Jesus
Pierce the darkness
Raise it high for all to see
Pierce the darkness
Let His light shine through us
Pierce the darkness
Halleluiah…
We proclaim the power of God
Through the name of Jesus
The spirits of hell must free
When we call His name
We’re tearing down
strongholds
Binding the strongman
Claiming our victory
For Jesus reigns over all

Will be stripped away

The wiseman on the rock
Decided to built a house (3x)
And the house will remain
The wind may blow
And the rain may fall (3x)
And the house will remain
The foolish man on the sand
Decided to built a house (3x)
And the house will come down
The wind may blow
And the rain may fall (3x)
And the house will come down
We all together
what shall we do (3x)
We all must love
Our love will remain
There is a place that I know
Where I need more often to go
A place of amazing
Comfort and rest
Where a smile never rare
Your love is free as the air
And I lack for nothing
When I can see
The love in Your eyes
And know that it’s all for me
I feel nothing at all
When I’m safe at the arms of
my Father
And if ever I fall
I’ll take comfort knowing that
you are here
There is joy, joy, joy
in the presence of the Lord
Singing
Hallelujah Amen (2)
Dance and celebrate
Dance and celebrate
Dance with joy
before the Lord (2)
There is none like You
No one else can touch my
heart like You do
I could search for all
eternity long
And find there is none like you
Your mercy flows like a river
And healing comes
from your heart
Suffering children find
rest in your arms
There is none like you
There is power, power
Wonder working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power
Wonder working power
In the precious blood
Of the Lamb
There is therefore now no
condemnation
For those who are in
Christ Jesus
For the law of the Spirit
Of life in Christ Jesus
Will set you free
From the law of sin and death
Ailasa Elelo Ailasa (2x)
There’s a boat on a journey
Sailing with Jesus on the sea
I can go in it, You can go in it
I can go in it, You can go in it
Jesus’ children all can go in it
Think about His love,
Think about His goodness.
Think about His grace
That's brought us through.
For as high as the
heavens above,
So great is the measure of our
Father's love
Great is the measure of our
Father's love
How could I forget His love
How could I forget His mercy
He satisfies - He satisfies
He satisfies my desires
Great is the measure
of our Father's love
Thirsty for more of you
More of Your Spirit & Truth
Wash me from all my sin
Fill me with Your Spirit again
You’re the River of Love
Flowing with grace &mercy
Flooding my soul
Filling my heart with peace
Oho River of Love
Like streams in the desert.
Giver of Life, giving Your life
And love to set me free.
Heal me and I will be healed
Save me & I will be saved
You’ve filled me
With songs of praise
Forever I will sing of
Your grace
If anyone is thirsty,
Let him come on in
When you drink the
Living Water

This is my desire to honor You
Lord, with all my heart I
worship You
All I have within me
I give You praise
All that I adore is in You
Lord, I give you my heart,

I live for You alone.
Every breath that I take
Every moment I’m awake
Lord, have Your way in me
Though we are many
We are one body (2) in Christ
One faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ
Binding us together in one cause
One hope in the one God
One Father over all
Thy word is a Lamp
unto my feet
And a Light unto my path
When I feel afraid
Think I’ve lost my way
Still you are right
here beside me
Jesus be my guide
Hold me to your side
And I will love you to the end
To be like Jesus

I’m laying them down
for the joy of the Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord

I’m pressed but not crushed
persecuted not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
I’m blessed beyond the curse
for his promise will endure
That His joy’s gonna
be my strength
Though the sorrow may
last for the night
His joy comes with the
morning
Trust in the Lord with
all your heart,
and lean not on your own
understanding
In all your ways
acknowledge Him
and He shall direct, He shall
direct your path
He will not allow your
foot to be bruised
He that keeps you
will not slumber
The Lord is near unto all those
who call upon Him,
to all who call upon
Him in truth
Down the Via Dolorosa
In Jerusalem that day
The soldiers tried to
But the crowd pressed into see
The Man condemned to
die on Calvary
He was bleeding from
the beating
There was stripes upon
His back
And He wore a crown of thorns
upon His head
And He bowed with every step
The scorn of those who cried
out for his death
Down the Via Dolorosa
Called the way of suffering
Like a Lamb came the Messiah
Christ the King
And He chose to walk that
road
Out of His love, for you and me
Down the via Dolorosa on the
way to Calvary
The blood that would cleanse
the souls of all men
Made its way through the heart
of Jerusalem
Down the Via Dolorosa called
the way of suffering
Like a lamb came the Messiah,
Christ the King
But He chose to walk that road
out of His love for you and me
Down the Via Dolorosa,
all the way to Calvary.
