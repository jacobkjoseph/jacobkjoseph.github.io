Lord I come to You
                  Bm        Em
Let my heart be changed, renewed
                   C
Flowing from the grace
            D7      G D
That I've found in You
G                   Em
Lord I've come to know
                  Bm    Em
The weaknesses I see in me
                  C D7
Will be stripped away
                 G G7
By the power of Your love

 C        D                     G     Em
Hold me close let your love sorround me
 C        D                  G G7
Bring me near draw me to your side
     C      D                      G Em
And as I wait I'll rise up like an eagle
                      C
And I will soar with You
                      D
Your Spirit leads me on
                 G D
In the power of Your love


Lord unveil my eyes
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love
As You live in me
Lord renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day
By the power of Your love</pre>
