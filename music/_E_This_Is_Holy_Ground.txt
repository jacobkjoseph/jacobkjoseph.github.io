This Is Holy Ground
                  G 
We're Standing On Holy Ground
                D                 Bm     A 
For The Lord Is here and where He is, is Holy x2

Chorus:
We Are Standing On Holy Ground
And I Know That There Are Angels All Around
Let Us Praise Jesus Now
We Are Standing In His Presence On Holy Ground
