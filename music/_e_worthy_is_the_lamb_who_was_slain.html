  Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
C                G
  Holy, Holy, is He

  Sing a new song, to him who sits on

VERSE 2:
D                    Am
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color

 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
D                                Am
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
C                     G
 To You the only wise King

C                         G
  At the mention of your name
D
  Jesus your name is power
Am                      
  Breath, and living water
C                     G
  Such a marvellous mystery...
