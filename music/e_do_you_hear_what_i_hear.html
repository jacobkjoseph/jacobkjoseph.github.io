C                          G      C 
Said the night wind to the little lamb,
C
Do you see what I see?
C                  G      C
Way up in the sky, little lamb?
C
Do you see what I see?
Am              Em  
A star, a star, dancing in the night,
       F       G        E
With a tail as big as a kite's,
       F       G7       C 
With a tail as big as a kite's.

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
C
Do you hear what I hear?
C                        G        C 
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy?
C
Do you hear what I hear?
Am               Em  
A song, a song, high above the trees,
       F         G         E
With a voice as big as the sea,
       F         G7        C 
With a voice as big as the sea.

C                            G      C 
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
C  
Do you know what I know?
C                    G      C
In your palace warm, mighty king?
C  
Do you know what I know?
Am               Em  
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
       F         G          E
Let us bring Him silver and gold
       F         G7         C 
Let us bring Him silver and gold.

C                           G     C 
Said the king to the people every where,
C
Listen to what I say
C                      G     C 
Pray for peace, people every where!
C
Listen to what I say

Am                Em  
A Child, a child, sleeping in the night
        F        G            E
He will bring us goodness and light
        F        G7           C 
He will bring us goodness and light.</pre>
