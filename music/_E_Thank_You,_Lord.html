Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

Chorus:

With an outstretched arm I'll bless Your Name and

For all You've done in my life,
Gm                              Dm
You took my darkness and gave me Your light

You took my sickness and heal all my pain
A#          C     A#          C
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord
