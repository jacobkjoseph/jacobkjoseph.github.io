I come before You today,

and there's just one thing that I want to say
A#          C     A#          C
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord
F                       C
For all You've given to me,

for all the blessings that I cannot see

Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

Chorus:
F                     C
With a grateful heart, with a song of praise

With an outstretched arm I'll bless Your Name and

For all You've done in my life,
Gm                              Dm
You took my darkness and gave me Your light
A#          C     A#          C
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord

You took my sin and my shame,
Gm                              Dm
You took my sickness and heal all my pain
A#          C     A#          C
Thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord</pre>
