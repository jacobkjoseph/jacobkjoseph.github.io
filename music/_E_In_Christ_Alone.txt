           D                 A
In Christ alone my hope is found
          G           A          D
He is my light, my strength, my song
                               A
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
                  G         A         D
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
                 G                     A
What heights of love, what depths of peace
                  G                      A
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
         D             A
My Comforter, my All in All
             G        A          D
Here in the love of Christ I stand

           D                 A
In Christ alone, who took on flesh
          G           A          D
Fullness of God in helpless babe
                               A
This gift of love and righteousness
                  G         A         D
Scorned by the ones He came to save
                 G                     A
‘Til on that cross as Jesus died
                 G                     A
The wrath of God was satisfied
         D             A
For every sin on Him was laid
                  G         A         D
Here in the death of Christ I live

           D                 A
There in the ground His body lay
          G           A          D
Light of the world by darkness slain
                               A
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
                  G         A         D
Up from the grave He rose again
                 G                     A
And as He stands in victory
                 G                     A
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me
         D             A
For I am His and He is mine
                  G         A         D
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

              E               B
No guilt in life, no fear in death
             A        B         E
This is the power of Christ in me
                                B
From life’s first cry to final breath
         A        B    E
Jesus commands my destiny
               A                 B
No power of hell, no scheme of man
           A                 B
Can ever pluck me from His hand
          E                 B
‘til He returns or calls me home
             A         B           E
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand
