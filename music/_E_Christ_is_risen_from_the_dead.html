Let no one caught in sin remain
  C2                D
Inside the lie of inward shame
G
But fix our eyes upon the cross
     C2            Em            D
And run to Him who showed great love
      G  C2  D
And bled for us
              G    C2  D
Freely You've bled for us


Chorus:
          G
Christ is risen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
      C2
Come awake, come awake
         Em               D
Come and rise up from the grave
          G
Christ is risen from the dead
We are one with Him again
      C2
Come awake, come awake
         Em               D
Come and rise up from the grave


Beneath the weight of all our sin
You bowed to none but heaven?s will
No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown
No burden great can hold You down
   G        C2  D
In strength You reign
                 G      C2    D
Forever let Your church proclaim


Bridge:
G  C2    Em            D
O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
The glory of God has defeated the night
O death, where is your sting?
O hell, where is your victory?
O church, come stand in the light
Our God is not dead! He's alive! He's alive!        </pre>
