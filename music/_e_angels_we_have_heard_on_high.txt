D              A        D
Angels we have heard on high
D               A         D
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
D                 A    D
And the mountains in reply
D              A         D
Echoing their joyous strains.

D    Em   D   G A    D           G A
Glo   o   o   oria   in excelsis Deo
D    Em   D   G A    D           G A D
Glo   o   o   oria   in excelsis Deo

D                    A  D
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
D               A        D
Why your joyous strains prolong?
D                A        D
What the gladsome tidings be
D                  A        D
Which inspire your heavenly song?

D             A       D
Come to Bethlehem and see
D                      A        D
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
D              A        D
Come, adore on bended knee,
D                     A      D
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.
