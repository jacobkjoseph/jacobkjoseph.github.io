D                              A
He is my everything, He is my all
          G                         D
He is my everything, both great and small

He is my everything, now how about you

                  G                         D
Like honey in the rock, Sweet honey in the rock 
       A           G            A         
For He tastes like honey in the rock

O taste and see that the Lord is good
       D           A            D
For He tastes like honey in the rock
