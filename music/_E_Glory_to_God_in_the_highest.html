O God, Almighty Father,



Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son

Lord God, Lamb of God,

Son of the Father

You take away the sin of the world

have mercy on us

You take away the sin of the world

receive our prayer

You are seated at the right hand of the Father

have mercy on us


For You alone are the Holy One,

You alone are the Lord,

You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, 

with the Holy Spirit,

in the glory of the Father.
