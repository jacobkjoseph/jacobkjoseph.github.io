Verse 1:
                         D
I am not skilled to understand
                                    Bm
What God has willed, what God has planned
                           A
I only know at his right hand
                       D
Stands one who is my savior


Verse 2:
                           D
I take him at his word and deed
                                Bm
Christ died to save me this I read
                           A
And in my heart I find a need
                  D
For him to be my savior


Pre-Chorus:
                                  G
That he would leave his place on high
                           D
And come for sinful man to die
                                  Asus
You count it strange, so once did I
                 D
Before I knew my savior


Chorus:
          Bm                 G
My savior loves, my savior lives
            D                A
My savior's always there for me
          Bm              G
My God he was, my God he is
            D             A        (A)
My God he's always gonna be
(x2)


Verse 3:
                           D
Yes, living, dying; let me bring
                                   Bm
My strength, my solace from this spring
                             A
That he who lives to be my king
                     D
Once died to be my savior        </pre>
