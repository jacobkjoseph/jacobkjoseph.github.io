You answered the call, and obeyed God's command
D                         A  
He sent you here, we know you're in His hands

Your message from the Word, touches our very soul

We've seen your faithfulness, and we want you to know



Chorus

Father, we love you, we appreciate all you do

And God sees the sacrifice, you've made for Jesus Christ

You pray for the lost, and God leads them to the Cross

And we know one day, you'll hear The Father say,

"My child, well done, my child, well done"



In the still quiet place, on your knees in prayer

God sees your tears, hears the burdens you bear

The Lord's by your side, He blesses all that you do

Through the good and bad times, He'll see you through



Chorus x 2

…"Oh my child, well done, my child, well done"
