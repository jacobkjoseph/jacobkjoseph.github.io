C               G       Am 
We fall down we lay our crowns
       F       G
At the feet of Jesus
C               G          Am 
The greatness of mercy and love
       F       G
At the feet of Jesus

CHORUS: 
             F     Am    G
And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy"
             F     Am    G
And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy"
             F     Am    G
And we cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy"
       C
Is the Lamb
