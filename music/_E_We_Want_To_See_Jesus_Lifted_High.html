ORDER: I V C B V C B C C E 

INTRO: C  G  Am  F  G  C  

VERSE: 
C              G            Am
We want to see Jesus lifted high,
              F     G           C
A banner that flies across the land,
                    G                Am
That all men might see the truth and know,
          F        G C
He is the way to heaven.


CHORUS: 
C             G               Am               F      G     C
We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
C             G               Am               F      G     C 
We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high.
    

BRIDGE: 
C       D                 Am
Step by step we're moving forward,
          G             C 
Little by little taking ground,
      G                    Am
Every prayer is a powerful weapon,
                G
Strongholds all come tumbling down
                                   C  G  am  F  G  C  
And down and down and down......


ENDING: 
C  G  Am     F     G      C 
         See Jesus lifted high
C  G  Am     F     G      C 
         See Jesus lifted high
