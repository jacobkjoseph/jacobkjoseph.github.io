A
I woke up in darkness surrounded by silence
   D                       A
Oh where, oh where have I gone?
A
I woke to reality losing its grip on me
   D                    A  
Oh where, where have I gone?
             E       D
'Cause I can see the light
E                D
Before I see the sunrise


Chorus:
F#m                D 
You called and You shouted
A                E
Broke through my deafness
        F#m              D
Now I'm breathing in and breathing out
A         E
I'm alive again
    F#m          D
You shattered my darkness
A              E
Washed away my blindness
        F#m              D
Now I'm breathing in and breathing out
A         E
I'm alive again

Verse 2:
A
Late have I loved You. You waited for me, I searched for You
D                A
What took me so long?
A                   
I was looking outside as if Love would ever want to hide
    D             A
I'm finding I was wrong
E                 D
'Cause I feel the wind
E                 D
Before it hits my skin

Chorus

Bridge:
         F#m             D
'Cause I want You, yes I want You
  A             E
I need You, and I'll do
           F#m             D
Whatever I have to just to get through
         A                E
'Cause I love You, yeah I love You        </pre>
