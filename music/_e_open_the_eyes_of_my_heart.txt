Open the eyes of my heart Lord, 
A
Open the eyes of my heart, 
          G      
I want to see You. 
          D
I want to see You.

           Bm              G
To see You high and lifted up, 
D                            A
Shining in the light of Your glory. 
Bm                      G
Pour out Your power and love, 
           A           G
As we sing holy, holy, holy.
