What a friend we have in Jesus,
D                           A
All ours sins and griefs to bear,
D                   G
What a privilege to carry
A                    D
Everything to God in prayer!
A                     D
O what peace we often forfeit,
G      D                A
O what needless pain we bear,
D                     G
All because we do not carry
A                    D
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour still our refuge;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He·ll take and shield thee;
Thou wilt find a solace there.
