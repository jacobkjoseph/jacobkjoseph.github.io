  <pre data-key="C" id="content" onclick="myFunction()">           C        G     Am
Will you come and follow me
            F        G
If I but call your name?
           C         G         Am
Will you go where you don't know
             F      C
And never be the same?
           Dm7 
Will you let my love be shown,
             C              G
Will you let my name be known,
           C     G         Am
Will you let my life be grown
           F       C
In you and you in me?

           C        G     Am
Will you leave yourself behind
            F        G
If I but call your name?
           C         G         Am
Will you care for cruel and kind
             F      C
And never be the same?
           Dm7 
Will you risk the hostile stare
             C              G
Should your life attract or scare?
           C     G         Am
Will you let me answer pray'r
           F       C
In you and you in me?

           C        G     Am
Will you let the blinded see
            F        G
If I but call your name?
           C         G         Am
Will you set the pris'ners free
             F      C
And never be the same?
           Dm7 
Will you kiss the leper clean,
             C              G
And do such as this unseen,
           C     G         Am
And admit to what I mean
           F       C
In you and you in me?

           C        G     Am
Will you love the 'you' you hide
            F        G
If I but call your name?
           C         G         Am
Will you quell the fear inside
             F      C
And never be the same?
           Dm7 
Will you use the faith you've found
             C              G
To reshape the world around,
           C     G         Am
Through my sight and touch and sound
           F       C
In you and you in me?

           C        G     Am
Lord, your summons echoes true
            F        G
When you but call my name.
           C         G         Am
Let me turn and follow you
             F      C
And never be the same.
           Dm7 
In your company I'll go
             C              G
Where your love and footsteps show.
           C     G         Am
Thus I'll move and live and grow
           F       C
In you and you in me.</pre>
