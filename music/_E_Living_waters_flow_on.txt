D                      Em   
    Living waters flow on
G                 D   
    Sweep away my pain
                             Em
    Bring your healing to my heart
A                      D
    Help me love once again

	Cares and worries get me down
	Fear of failure fills my day
	When I'm lost and all alone
	Help me Lord to find Your way

	People knocking at my door
	Strangers seeking love and care
	Never let me turn them down
	Teach me gently how to share

	Children come into my life
	With their laughter and their song
	When will I become like them
	Teach me Lord to sing along
