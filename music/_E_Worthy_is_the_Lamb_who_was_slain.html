INTRO    (x2)
D Am C G     

VERSE 1:
D              Am
  Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
C                G
  Holy, Holy, is He
D                 Am
  Sing a new song, to him who sits on
C                 G
  Heaven's mercy seat
                         (x2)

CHORUS:
D
  Holy, Holy, Holy

  Is the Lord God Almighty
C                             G
  Who was, and is, and is to come

  With all creation I sing
Am
  Praise to the King of Kings
C
  You are my everything
G                    D     Am  C  G
  And I will adore You...

VERSE 2:
D                    Am
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color
C                        G
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
D                                Am
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
C                     G
 To You the only wise King

VERSE 3:
D                    Am
  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
C                         G
  At the mention of your name
D
  Jesus your name is power
Am                      
  Breath, and living water
C                     G
  Such a marvellous mystery...
