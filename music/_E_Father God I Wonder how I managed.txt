Em                        D
Father God I Wonder how I managed
                      C
to exist without the knowledge
         D                          B7
of Your parenthood and Your loving care
    Em                       D
But now I am Your son, I am adopted in Your family 
    C 
and I can ever be alone
        D                 B7
'cause Father God You're there beside me

Chorus:
Em     C 
I will sing Your praises 
D       G
I will sing Your praises
Em      Am
I will sing your praises
D         B7
for ever more

Em     C 
I will sing Your praises 
D       G
I will sing Your praises
Em      Am
I will sing your praises
D         Em
for ever more
